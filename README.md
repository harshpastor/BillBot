# 🤖 BillBot — Your Personal Bill Organizer

**BillBot** is a smart automation platform that extracts PDF bills from your email, identifies the bill type and date using intelligent parsing, and organizes them into structured folders — automatically!

No more digging through inboxes or scattered downloads — BillBot sorts your life, one bill at a time.

- 🔍 Optional OCR support for scanned/image-based PDFs
- 🌐 Web dashboard to view & trigger scans (Flask-based)
